## ✨ Features

* **4 algorithms** — DFS generation, BFS, A\*, and Dijkstra solving
* **Step-by-step playback** — play/pause, next, previous, adjustable speed
* **Live data structures** — stack, queue, or open set displayed in real time
* **Path visualization** — final solution path highlighted with step count
* **g/f score overlay** — toggle cost scores on each cell during A\*
* **6 maze sizes** — from 3×3 up to 8×8
* **Zero dependencies** — single `.html` file, works offline, no install needed

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Just open the file in your browser
open index.html
```

Or double-click `index.html` — that's it. No server, no npm, no build step.

## 🧠 Algorithms

### 🌲 Generation — Depth-First Search (DFS)

Carves a perfect maze by exploring randomly and backtracking when stuck. Every cell is guaranteed to be reachable.

```
Start at (0,0)
→ Pick a random unvisited neighbor
→ Remove the wall between them
→ Move to that neighbor, push old position to stack
→ No neighbors? Pop from stack (backtrack)
→ Repeat until all cells are visited
```

**Data structure:** Stack (LIFO)

---

### 🔵 Solving — Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Explores cells level by level, guaranteeing the **shortest path** in an unweighted maze.

**Data structure:** Queue (FIFO)  
**Optimal:** ✅ Yes  
**Time complexity:** O(V + E)

---

### 🔮 Solving — A\*

Uses a **Manhattan distance heuristic** to guide search toward the exit. Typically explores fewer cells than BFS while still finding the optimal path.

**Data structure:** Priority queue (sorted by f = g + h)  
**Optimal:** ✅ Yes  
**Time complexity:** O(E log V)

---

### 📊 Solving — Dijkstra's Algorithm

Explores by lowest accumulated cost. Behaves like BFS on a uniform-cost maze, optimal and complete.

**Data structure:** Priority queue (sorted by distance)  
**Optimal:** ✅ Yes  
**Time complexity:** O(E log V)

## 🎨 Cell Color Legend

| Color | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 🟡 Yellow | Current cell being processed |
| 🟢 Teal | Path from start to exit |
| 🔵 Blue | Open set (A\* / Dijkstra candidates) |
| 🔴 Red | Closed set (already fully explored) |
| Dark teal | Visited cell |
| Dark | Unvisited cell |

## 📁 Project Structure

```
index.html
script.js
style.css
README.md
```

The visualizer is intentionally a single self-contained file. All logic, styles, and markup live together so it can be shared, run, and modified without any tooling.

The code inside is organized into clear sections:

```
CONSTANTS     → OPPOSITE, MOVES, DIRS — defined once, shared everywhere
GRID UTILS    → makeGrid(), cloneGrid()
ALGORITHMS    → buildDFSSteps(), buildBFSSteps(), buildAStarSteps(), buildDijkstraSteps()
PATH BUILDER  → buildPath() — shared by all solvers
RENDER        → renderMaze() — pure function, grid → DOM
UI             → updateUI(), syncTabs()
CONTROLS      → togglePlay(), stepForward(), stepBackward(), changeSize(), etc.
INIT          → window.onload
```

## 🔧 Customization

**Change default maze size** — find `let mazeSize = 5;` and update the value.

**Add a new solving algorithm** — implement `buildXxxSteps(grid, size)` returning an array of step objects with `{ type, cur, msg, path, grid }`, then add it to `buildSolveSteps()` and register a pill button.

**Change wall color** — find `.cell { border: 2.5px solid rgba(99,255,200,0.55); }` in the `<style>` block.

**Change animation default speed** — find `let speed = 300;` and update the value.
